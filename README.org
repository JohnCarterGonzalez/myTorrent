#+TITLE: myTorrent - BitTorrent Client
#+AUTHOR: JohnCarter Gonzalez

* Introduction
  myTorrent is a simple BitTorrent client that decodes bencoded torrent files and interacts with the BitTorrent network to download files. It's a command-line utility written in shell script, making use of utilities like curl for HTTP requests and standard Linux tools for data manipulation.

* How It Works
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: how-it-works
  :END:
  myTorrent works by implementing the BitTorrent protocol which includes parsing .torrent files, communicating with trackers, and handling peer connections to download files.

** Bencode Decoding
   Bencode is the encoding format used by the BitTorrent protocol to store and transmit loosely structured data. It supports strings, integers, lists, and dictionaries. myTorrent can decode this data into JSON format.

** Torrent File Parsing
   Parses .torrent files to extract key information such as announce URLs, file length, and pieces info which is essential for downloading the file.

** Tracker Interaction
   Communicates with trackers to get a list of peers, send periodic updates, and receive a list of potential peers to connect to.

** Peer Communication
   Establishes TCP connections with peers, completes handshakes, and manages data transfer including requesting pieces of the file and assembling them.

** File Assembly
   Once all the pieces are downloaded, myTorrent verifies each piece's integrity with SHA-1 hash checks before assembling them into the final file.

  myTorrent is divided into stages, each responsible for a specific aspect of the BitTorrent protocol:

  1. Bencode Decoding
  2. Torrent File Parsing
  3. Tracker Communication
  4. Peer Handshake and Data Exchange
  5. File Download and Assembly

  The below graph represents the flow of data and control through the application:

* Usage

  Basic commands for interacting with the myTorrent client:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # To decode a bencoded string
  ./your_bittorrent.sh decode <bencoded_string>

  # To parse a torrent file and print info
  ./your_bittorrent.sh info <path_to_torrent_file>

  # To get the list of peers from the tracker
  ./your_bittorrent.sh peers <path_to_torrent_file>

  # To perform a handshake with a peer
  ./your_bittorrent.sh handshake <path_to_torrent_file> <peer_ip>:<peer_port>

  # To download a specific piece of the file
  ./your_bittorrent.sh download_piece -o <output_path> <path_to_torrent_file> <piece_index>

  # To download the entire file
  ./your_bittorrent.sh download -o <output_path> <path_to_torrent_file>
  #+END_SRC
