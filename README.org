*** Bencode (pronounced Bee-encode) is a serialization format used in the BitTorrent protocol.
It is used in torrent files and in communication between trackers and peers.

Bencode supports four data types:

    - strings
    - integers
    - arrays
    - dictionaries

Strings are encoded as `<length>:<contents>`. For example, the string `"hello"` is encoded as `"5:hello"`.

This project implements a decode command which takes a bencoded value as input and prints the decoded value as JSON.
